This project is a simulated malware designed for educational and research purposes only. It demonstrates how a program can:

  - Copy itself to the %APPDATA% directory

  - Modify the Windows Registry (Run and RunOnce keys)

  - Persist by launching automatically on user login

  - Display a message repeatedly in a loop
